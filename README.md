Mustafa Lutaaya.
I am called Lutaaya Mustafa a Ugandan by nationality.
I have basic computer experience of over 17 years which has been gradually been increasing from abit of hardware to softwares such as OS Windows, Adobe Packages (InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop), Microsoft Packages(Word, Powerpoint) and other basic knowledge such as changing OS, creating folders and so on.
Only part of the computer that i had always admired but never got access or resources to do it was how the computer works (Coding & Programming) which is basically the course i am doing at REDI right now titled Introduction to coding, data and design.
I feel lucky to finally be part of this course that is enabling me tap into my long life desire of understanding how a computer works and i find it so far addictive and very interesting in ways it challenges me.
