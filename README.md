Mustafa Lutaaya.

My names are Lutaaya Mustafa and i'm a Ugandan currently living in Germany.

Started using computers in the year 2006 and as the years went on i developed vast computer experience in various key areas ranging from basic knowledge of computer hardware and basic software( changing windows, creating folders, typing in notepdad, playing games, music and videos) to knowing how to run and use softwares such as the Microsoft Office Package (Word, powerpoint), Adobe Package(Photohsop, inDesign, Illustrator), downloading and uploading, installing software and many others.

With all those years using a computer i had always wondered and wanted to find out how computers really work to be able to execute tasks that we request them to perform. Yes, i knew it was something about "programming languages" and "coding" but apart from me knowing about the terms, i had no other clue about any of them and also sadly had no access to getting into a programme that could help me learn more about them.

My deep rooted desire to not only know more about them but also one day, be able to design an application or develop and design a website motivated me to apply to join this course immediately i heard about it as it was going to be a dream worth fulfilling.

Being apart of the "INTRO TO CODING, DATA AND DESIGN" course at REDI School has not only enabled me tap into my long life desire of knowing how a computer works but also proved interesting, knowledge filled and worthy-challenging which has made me develop more passion for learning more about software development.
